# Memo - a game for you and your friends ⭐

## Description 👋
**Memo** is a game that develops memory and attentiveness. The main goal of the game is to find pairs of identical cards. The application is developed in Python for two users using sockets for network communication and the PyQt library for the graphical interface.

## Features 💅

* Local network game support
* Easy to use game logic
* Easy interface for users
* Funny memes with developers photos

## Instructions 📖

1. Download the server.exe and client.exe files from the release section for Windows. 
2. Ensure that both devices are connected to the same network.
3. Start server.exe on one computer to host the game.
4. Run client.exe on a different computer to join the game.

To play alone, run both server.exe and client.exe on the same machine.

## How to Play 🎰

1. Once connected, players take turns flipping two cards, but only when the "Your Turn" button is lit.
2. Click on two cards to reveal them. If they match, they stay visible, and you earn a point.
3. If the cards don't match, they will flip back over after a few seconds.
4. Wait for your turn again when the "Your Turn" button lights up.
5. The game continues until all pairs are matched, and the player with the most points wins!

## Development opportunities 🙏

In new versions, the developers plan to add:

* More cards and themes: You will be able to select cards with different images and categories.
* Adjustments for different age groups: Various difficulty levels will be added to adapt the game to different ages
